# ROMAN NUMERALS

Create a conversion mechanism from integers to a Roman representation (a string).

1. 1, 2 and 3 become I, II and III respectively.
2. 5 and 10 become V and X respectively.
3. 6 become VI, as symbols are additive.
4. 4 becomes IV, as symbols are used subtractively (in this case subtracting 1 from 5) to avoid repeating a symbol more than three times in a row.
